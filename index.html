        <h2>Definition of a triangle</h2>
        <p>A triangle is a polygon with three edges and three vertices. It is one of the basic shapes in geometry.</p>
        <p>This website allows the user to input the lengths of the sides of a triangle, and returns whether these sides form an equilateral, isosceles, or scalene triangle or if the sides cannot make a triangle at all.</p>
        <h3>Types of a triangle</h3>
        <p>There are three types of triangle: isosceles, equilateral and scalene triangle.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <img src="images/eq.png">
                <p><strong>An equilateral triangle</strong> has all sides the same length.</p>
                <p>An equilateral triangle is also a regular polygon with all angles measuring 60Â°.</p> 
            </li>
            <li>
                <img src="images/iso.png">
                <p><strong>An isosceles triangle</strong> has two sides of equal length.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <img src="images/scalene.png">
                <p><strong>A scalene triangle</strong>  has all its sides of different lengths.</p> 
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>How to know the type of triangle</h3>
        <p>This is a website that checks what type of a triangle you inqured and returns the result.</p>
        <p><em>If the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is less than or equal to the length of the third side, this CANNOT be a triangle hence NOT a triangle will be returned</em></p>
        <p><span><strong>Please enter the length of each side</strong></span></p>
        <p><input type="number" id="side1" placeholder="length of side 1"></p>
        <p><input type="number" id="side2" placeholder="length of side 2"></p>
        <p><input type="number" id="side3" placeholder="length of side 3"></p>
        <button type = "button" onclick = "getResult()">Result</button>
